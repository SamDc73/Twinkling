Note: <p>title:: Creating High Performance Culture | Patty McCord 
full-title:: Creating High Performance Culture | Patty McCord | Talks at Google
People:: [[Patty McCord]]
Channel::  [[Talks at Google]]
Youtube-id:: thzDy5A-KfE
Year::  2018</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty McCord is an expert on company culture</li>
<li>She was an early employee at Netflix and co-author of the famous Netflix culture deck</li>
<li>Her book "Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility" aims to convey the message of the Netflix culture deck</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Netflix Culture Deck</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty didn't write or co-author the Netflix culture deck with Reed Hastings (Netflix CEO)</li>
<li>At her previous company Pure Software, her job was to merge employee handbooks after acquisitions with the fewest policies</li>
<li>The goal at Netflix was to create a company culture they wanted to work in, avoiding brilliant but difficult people</li>
<li>They aimed to give employees freedom and the ability to say no</li>
<li>The culture deck outlined the desired culture, and Patty's job was to implement it in reality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Scott Bowman Story</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty shared a story about being on stage with Scotty Bowman, the winningest hockey coach in NHL history</li>
<li>The event was in Montreal at the Bell Centre, home of the Stanley Cup</li>
<li>Despite expecting a small audience, she found herself on stage with thousands of people, with Scotty being treated like a legend</li>
<li>Scotty explained his process of giving feedback to players every 10 games, involving self-assessments, stats, and plans for the next stretch</li>
<li>This resonated with Patty, who dislikes the annual performance review and believes in continuous feedback for high performance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How to Navigate Your Career</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty emphasizes the importance of finding a role where your talents match the company's needs</li>
<li>If you dread going to work or feel undervalued, something is wrong</li>
<li>It's your responsibility to navigate your career, not wait for others to notice your unhappiness or fulfillment</li>
<li>Learn from the work you hate, and be cognizant of what you're learning, liking, and disliking</li>
<li>Your talent is important, so ensure you're in a place that recognizes it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty spends time with big companies trying to transform into agile tech companies</li>
<li>She believes employees can create the desired workplace by being vocal and having honest conversations</li>
<li>She shares a story about a basketball coach's candid perspective on cutting players, contrasting it with the lack of honesty in corporate settings</li>
<li>Real transformation comes from speaking truthfully about management and employees voicing their needs and the company's future</li>
<li>Interviewing elsewhere helps assess your worth and find new opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Low Performers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty discusses how Netflix handled low performers, using the example of transitioning from DVDs to streaming</li>
<li>They realized they lacked the IT expertise to handle the massive bandwidth requirements for streaming</li>
<li>As a result, they turned over 97% of the IT team that year, with many moving to another company better suited to their skills</li>
<li>Hiring the wrong person is the company's fault, not the employee's</li>
<li>If someone is close but not quite right, be honest about it during the hiring process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Severance Packages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty aimed to avoid putting employees on performance improvement plans when their roles were no longer needed</li>
<li>Instead, she offered generous severance packages to part ways amicably</li>
<li>This required having a top-notch recruiting team to hire for evolving needs</li>
<li>She advocated paying competitive market rates based on real data from recruiters and employee interviews elsewhere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Pay for Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patty doesn't have an issue with annual compensation reviews but dislikes combining them with performance reviews and feedback</li>
<li>She believes in providing continuous feedback for performance improvement, not just annually</li>
<li>Compensation should be transparent, market-based, and reflect the importance of each role to the company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Creating a Culture of Excellence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Achieving excellence without toxicity or fear involves:<ul>
<li>Modeling the right behavior and calling out unacceptable conduct</li>
<li>Encouraging debate focused on the customer/product, not personal attacks</li>
<li>Viewing the team as a collective solving problems, not individuals competing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's everyone's job to recruit and build amazing teams, not just HR's</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Ambitious Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>For ambitious, risky projects that don't go well, conduct a postmortem:</li>
<li>Evaluate what could have been done differently</li>
<li>Assess if the scope, team, goals, or timelines were misjudged</li>
<li>Apply lessons learned for continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
